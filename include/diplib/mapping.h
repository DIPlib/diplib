/// The mapping function is defined as follows: sample values higher or equal to `upperBound` are mapped
/// to the `outMax` value, and sample values lower or equal to `lowerBound` are mapped to the `outMin` value.
/// `method` determines how pixel values are mapped in between these limits. Valid strings for `mode` are:
///  - `"linear"`: linear mapping.
///  - `"signed linear"`: linear mapping with zero at fixed value in the middle of the output range.
///  - `"logarithmic"`: logarithmic mapping.
///  - `"signed logarithmic"`: logarithmic mapping with zero at fixed location in the output range.
///  - `"erf"`: error function mapping.
///  - `"decade"`: decade contrast stretch (uses `parameter1`).
///  - `"sigmoid"`: sigmoid function contrast stretch (uses `parameter1` and `parameter2`).
///
/// `in` must be real-valued. `out` will be of an arithmetic type (single or double float), unless it is protected,
/// in which case its data type is preserved (see \ref protect).
///
/// Below follow the equations used for each of the mappings. They all use (with the percentile computed across all
/// samples, not independently for each channel):
///
/// ```cpp
///     dfloat inMin = dip::Percentile( in, {}, lowerBound ).As< dfloat >();
///     dfloat inMax = dip::Percentile( in, {}, upperBound ).As< dfloat >();
///     in = dip::Clip( in, inMin, inMax );
/// ```
///
/// Next, `"linear"` computes `(( outMax - outMin ) / ( inMax - inMin )) * ( in - inMin ) + outMin`.
///
/// `"signed linear"` computes the same thing, but first sets `inMax = std::max( std::abs(inMax), std::abs(inMin) )`,
/// and `inMin = -inMax`.
///
/// `"logarithmic"` computes:
///
/// ```cpp
///     dfloat offset = inMin - 1;
///     out = ( outMax - outMin ) * Log( in - offset ) / std::log( inMax - offset ) + outMin;
/// ```
///
/// whereas `"signed logarithmic"` computes a similar mapping, but first sets
/// `inMax = std::max( std::abs(inMax), std::abs(inMin) )`, and `inMin = -inMax`, and then takes the logarithm
/// of `in+1` for positive `in` or `inMax+in+1` for negative `in`.
///
/// `"erf"` applies a mapping identical to that of the `dip::ErfClip` function with the lower range bound set to
/// `inMin` and the upper one set to `inMax`, and then scales the output to the requested range. Note that in this
/// case, the input is not hard-clipped to the range, but soft-clipped through the error function.
///
/// `"decade"` applies the following mapping to each sample:
///
/// ```cpp
///     dfloat decade = std::log10(( inMax - inMin ) / ( in - inMin + EPSILON ));
///     if( decade < parameter1 )
///        out = ( outMax - outMin ) * ( 1 + std::floor(decade) - decade ) + outMin;
///     else
///        out = 0;
/// ```
///
/// `"sigmoid"` applies the following mapping to each sample:
///
/// ```cpp
///     dfloat min = sigmoid( parameter1 * inMin + parameter2 );
///     dfloat max = sigmoid( parameter1 * inMax + parameter2 );
///     out = ( outMax - outMin ) / ( max - min ) * ( sigmoid( parameter1 * in + parameter2 ) - min ) + outMin;
/// ```
///
/// Here, the `sigmoid` function is `sigmoid(x) = x / ( 1 + std::abs(x) )`. `parameter1` represents the slope and
/// `parameter2` the point around which the sigmoid is centered.
