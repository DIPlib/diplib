/// The weights are in `filter`. If `isComplex`, then the values in `filter` are interpreted as real/imaginary
/// pairs. In this case, `filter` must have an even length, with each two consecutive elements representing a
/// single filter weight. The `filter.data()` pointer can thus be cast to \ref dip::dcomplex.
///
/// The origin is placed either at the index given by `origin` if it's non-negative, or at index
/// `filter.size() / 2` if `origin` is negative. Note that `filter.size() / 2` is either the middle pixel
/// if the filter is odd in length, or the pixel to the right of the center if it is even in length:
///
/// size of `filter` | `origin` | origin location
/// ---------------- |:--------:|:---------------:
/// any              |    `1`   | `x 0 x x x x`
/// any              |    `5`   | `x x x x x 0`
/// any odd value    |   `-1`   | `x x 0 x x  `
/// any even value   |   `-1`   | `x x x 0 x x`
///
/// Note that, if positive, `origin` must be an index to one of the samples in the `filter` array:
/// `origin < filter.size()`.
///
/// `symmetry` indicates the filter shape: `"general"` (or an empty string) indicates no symmetry.
/// `"even"` indicates even symmetry, `"odd"` indicates odd symmetry, and `"conj"` indicates complex conjugate
/// symmetry. In these three cases, the filter represents the left half of the full filter,
/// with the rightmost element at the origin (and not repeated). The full filter is thus always odd in size.
/// `"d-even"`, `"d-odd"` and `"d-conj"` are similar, but duplicate the rightmost element, yielding
/// an even-sized filter. The origin for the symmetric filters is handled identically to the general filter case.
///
/// The following table summarizes the result of using various `symmetry` values. The `filter` array in all
/// cases has *n* elements represented in this example as [*a*,*b*,*c*].

/// \brief Computes the mean shift vector for each pixel in the image
///
/// The output image is a vector image, indicating the step to take to move the window center to its center of
/// mass. Repeatedly following the vector will lead to a local maximum of the image `in`. `in` must be scalar
/// and real-valued.
///
/// The mean shift at a given location $x$ is then given by
///
/// $$ s = \frac{ \sum_i{(x-x_i) w(x-x_i) f(x_i)} }{ \sum_i{w(x-x_i) f(x_i)} }
///       = \frac{ \left ( -x w \right) \ast f }{ w \ast f } \; , $$
///
/// where $f$ is the image, $w$ is a windowing function, and $\ast$ indicates convolution.
///
/// We use a Gaussian window with sizes given by `sigmas`. A Gaussian window causes slower convergence than a
/// uniform window, but yields a smooth trajectory and more precise results (according to Comaniciu
/// and Meer, 2002). It also allows us to rewrite the above (with $g_\sigma$ the Gaussian window with
/// parameter $\sigma$) as
///
/// $$ s = \frac{ \left ( -x g_\sigma \right) \ast f }{ g_\sigma \ast f }
///       = \frac{ \left ( \sigma^2 \nabla g_\sigma \right) \ast f }{ g_\sigma \ast f } \; . $$
///
/// Thus, we can write this filter as `dip::Gradient(in, sigmas) / dip::Gauss(in, sigmas) * sigmas * sigmas`.
/// See \ref dip::Derivative for more information on the parameters. Do not use `method = "finitediff"`,
/// as it will lead to nonsensical results.
