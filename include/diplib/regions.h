/// whereas in a normal dilation, the label with the larger value would grow over the one with the smaller value.

/// (see \ref connectivity). Alternating connectivity is only implemented for 2D and 3D images.

/// \brief Construct a graph for the given labeled image.
///
/// Each region (object/label) in the image `labels` is a node. Edges represent neighborhood relations between regions.
/// Because the `dip::Graph` class uses the vertex ID as an index into an array, it is recommended that this function
/// be called with a labeled image where labels are more or less consecutive. If `dip::Maximum( labels ).As< dip::uint >()`
/// (i.e. the largest label ID) is much larger than `dip::GetObjectLabels( labels ).size()` (i.e. the number of labels),
/// then the `dip::Graph` object will have many unused vertices, and hence waste space. use `dip::Relabel` to modify
/// the `labels` image to have consecutive labels.
///
/// `mode` indicates how to construct the graph. It can be one of the following strings:
///  - `"touching"`: two regions are neighbors if they have at least one pixel that is 1-connected to the other
///    region. That is, the two regions directly touch.
///  - `"watershed"`: two regions are neighbors if there is a background pixel that is 1-connected to the two
///    regions. That is, the two regions are separated by a 1-pixel watershed line. Note that, in this case,
///    two regions that directly touch will not be recognized as neighbors!
///
/// In both modes, region with ID 0 (the background) is not included in the graph. But note that there is a vertex
/// with index 0, which will not be connected to any other vertex.
/// To include the background, simply increment the label image by 1.
///
/// Edge weights are computed as follows: The fraction of boundary pixels for region 1 that connect to
/// region 2 is determined. The fraction of boundary pixels for regions 2 that connect to regions 1 is determined.
/// One minus the larger of these two fractions is the edge weight. Thus, edge weights have a value in the
/// half-open interval [0,1). If one of the two regions has a very large fraction of its perimeter connected
/// to another region, then the edge weight is very small to indicate a strong connection.

/// This function is similar to the one above, but edge weights are derived from the absolute difference
/// between `featureValues` for the two regions joined by the edge. Vertex values are set to the feature value
/// for the region.
///
/// The input `featureValues` is a view over a specific feature in a `dip::Measurement` object. Only the
/// first value of the feature is used. For features with multiple values, select a value using the
/// `dip::Measurement::IteratorFeature::Subset` method, or pick a column in the `dip::Measurement` object
/// directly using `dip::Measurement::FeatureValuesView`.
///
