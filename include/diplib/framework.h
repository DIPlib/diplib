/// The various frameworks implement iterating over image pixels, giving access to a single pixel, a whole image line,
/// or a pixel's neighborhood. The programmer needs to define a function that loops over one dimension. The framework
/// will call this function repeatedly to process all the image's lines, thereby freeing the programmer from
/// implementing loops over multiple dimensions. This process allows most of *DIPlib*'s filters to be dimensionality
/// independent, with little effort from the programmer. See \ref design_frameworks.
///
/// There are three frameworks that represent three different types of image processing functions:
///
/// - The Scan framework, to process individual pixels across multiple input and output images: \ref dip::Framework::Scan.
/// - The Separable framework, to apply separable filters: \ref dip::Framework::Separable.
/// - The Full framework, to apply non-separable filters: \ref dip::Framework::Full.

/// type requested by the `inBufferTypes` and `outBufferTypes` parameters, but are passed as `void*`.
/// `lineFilter` should cast these pointers to the right types.
/// Output buffers are not initialized, `lineFilter` is responsible for setting all its values.
///
/// Output images (unless protected) will be resized to match the (singleton-expanded) input, but have a number of
/// tensor elements specified by `nTensorElements`, and their type will be set to that specified by `outImageTypes`.
/// Protected output images must have the correct size and type, otherwise an exception will be thrown.
/// The scan function can be called without input images. In this case, at least one output image must be given.
/// The dimensions of the first output image will be used to direct the scanning, and the remaining output images (if
/// any) will be adjusted to the same size. It is also possible to give no output images, as would be the case for a
/// reduction operation such as computing the average pixel value. However, it makes no sense to call the scan
/// function without input nor output images.
///
/// Tensors are passed to `lineFilter` as vectors, if the shape is important, store this information in `lineFilter`.
/// `nTensorElements` gives the number of tensor elements for each output image. These are created as standard vectors.
/// The calling function can reshape the tensors after the call to `dip::Framework::Scan`. It is not necessary nor
/// enforced that the tensors for each image (both input and output) are the same, the calling function is to make
/// sure the tensors satisfy whatever constraints.
///
/// However, if the option \ref dip::Framework::ScanOption::TensorAsSpatialDim is given, then the tensor is cast to a
/// spatial dimension, and singleton expansion is applied. Thus, `lineFilter` does not need to check `inTensorLength`
/// or `outTensorLength` (they will be 1), and the output tensor size is guaranteed to match the largest input tensor.
/// `nTensorElements` is ignored. Even with a single input image, where no singleton expansion can happen, it is
/// beneficial to use the \ref dip::Framework::ScanOption::TensorAsSpatialDim option, as `lineFilter` can be simpler
/// and faster. Additionally, the output tensor shape is identical to the input image's. In case of multiple inputs,
/// the first input image that has as many tensor elements as the (singleton-expanded) output will model the output
/// tensor shape.
///
/// If the option \ref dip::Framework::ScanOption::ExpandTensorInBuffer is given, then the input buffers passed to
/// `lineFilter` will contain the tensor elements as a standard, column-major matrix. If the image has tensors stored
/// differently, buffers will be used. This option is not used when \ref dip::Framework::ScanOption::TensorAsSpatialDim
/// is set, as that forces the tensor to be a single sample. Use this option if you need to do computations with the
/// tensors, but do not want to bother with all the different tensor shapes, which are meant only to save memory.
/// Note, however, that this option does not apply to the output images. When expanding the input tensors in this way,
/// it makes sense to set the output tensor to a full matrix. Don't forget to specify the right size in `nTensorElements`.
///
/// The framework function sets the output pixel size to that of the first input image with a defined pixel size,
/// and it sets the color space to that of the first input image with matching number of tensor elements.
/// The calling function is expected to "correct" these values if necessary.
///
/// The buffers are not guaranteed to be contiguous, please use the `stride` and `tensorStride` values to access samples.
/// All buffers contain `bufferLength` pixels. `position` gives the coordinates for the first pixel in the buffers,
/// subsequent pixels occur along dimension `dimension`. `position[dimension]` is not necessarily zero.
/// However, when \ref dip::Framework::ScanOption::NeedCoordinates is not given, `dimension` and `position` are
/// meaningless. The framework is allowed to treat all pixels in the image as a single image line in this case.
///
/// If `in` and `out` share an image, then it is possible that the corresponding input and output buffers point to the
/// same memory. The input image will be overwritten with the processing result. That is, all processing can be
/// performed in place. The scan framework is intended for pixel-wise processing, not neighborhood-based processing,
/// so there is never a reason not to work in place. However, some types of tensor processing might want to write to
/// the output without invalidating the input for that same pixel. In this case, give the option
/// \ref dip::Framework::ScanOption::NotInPlace. It will make sure that the output buffers given to the line filter
/// do not alias the input buffers.
///
/// `dip::Framework::Scan` will process the image using multiple threads, so `lineFilter` will be called from multiple
/// threads simultaneously. If it is not thread safe, specify \ref dip::Framework::ScanOption::NoMultiThreading as an
/// option. the `SetNumberOfThreads` method to `lineFilter` will be called once before the processing starts, when

/// The buffers are always of the type specified in `inBuffer` and `outBuffer`, but are passed as `void*`.
/// `lineFilter` should cast these pointers to the right types. The output buffer is not initialized, `lineFilter`
/// is responsible for setting all its values.
///
/// The `process` array specifies along which dimensions the filtering is applied. If it is an empty array, all
/// dimensions will be processed. Otherwise, it must have one element per image dimension.
///
/// The output image (unless protected) will be resized to match the input, and its type will be set to that specified
/// by `outImage`. A protected output image must have the correct size and type, otherwise an exception will be thrown.
/// The separable filter always has one input and one output image.
///
/// If the option \ref dip::Framework::SeparableOption::DontResizeOutput is given, then the sizes of the output image
/// will be kept (but it could still be reforged to change the data type). In this case, the length of the input and
/// output buffers can differ, causing the intermediate result image to change size one dimension at the time, as each
/// dimension is processed. For example, if the input image is of size 256x256, and the output is 1x1, then in a first
/// step 256 lines are processed, each with 256 pixels as input and a single pixel as output. In a second step, a single
/// line of 256 pixels is processed yielding the final single-pixel result. In the same case, but with an output of
/// 64x512, 256 lines are processed, each with 256 pixels as input and 64 pixels as output. In the second step,
/// 64 lines are processed, each with 256 pixels as input and 512 pixels as output. This option is useful for functions
/// that scale and do other geometric transformations, as well as functions that compute projections.
///
/// Tensors are passed to `lineFilter` as vectors, if the shape is important, store this information in `lineFilter`.
/// The output image will have the same tensor shape as the input except if the option
/// \ref dip::Framework::SeparableOption::ExpandTensorInBuffer is given. In this case, the input buffers passed to
/// `lineFilter` will contain the tensor elements as a standard, column-major matrix, and the output image will be
/// a full matrix of that size. If the input image has tensors stored differently, buffers will be used when processing
/// the first dimension; for subsequent dimensions, the intermediate result will already contain the full matrix.
/// Use this option if you need to do computations with the tensors, but do not want to bother with all the different
/// tensor shapes, which are meant only to save memory.
///
/// However, if the option \ref dip::Framework::SeparableOption::AsScalarImage is given, then the line filter is called
/// for each tensor element, effectively causing the filter to process a sequence of scalar images, one for each tensor
/// element. This is accomplished by converting the tensor into a spatial dimension for both the input and output image,
/// and setting the `process` array for the new dimension to false. For example, given an input image `in` with 3 tensor
/// elements, `filter(in,out)` will result in an output image `out` with 3 tensor elements, and computed as if `filter`
/// were called 3 times: `filter(in[0],out[0])`, `filter(in[1],out[1])`, and `filter(in[2],out[2])`.
///
/// The framework function sets the output tensor size to that of the input image, and it sets the color space to that
/// of the input image if the two images have matching number of tensor elements (these can differ if
/// \ref dip::Framework::SeparableOption::ExpandTensorInBuffer is given). The calling function is expected to "correct"
/// these values if necessary. Note the difference here with the `Scan` and `Full` frameworks: it is not possible to
/// apply a separate filter to a tensor image and obtain an output with a different tensor representation
/// (because the question arises: in which image pass does this change occur?).
///
/// The buffers are not guaranteed to be contiguous, please use the `stride` and `tensorStride` values to access samples.
/// The \ref dip::Framework::SeparableOption::UseInputBuffer and \ref dip::Framework::SeparableOption::UseInputBuffer
/// options force the use of temporary buffers to store each image line. These temporary buffers always have contiguous
/// samples, with the tensor stride equal to 1 and the spatial stride equal to the number of tensor elements.
/// That is, the tensor elements for each pixel are contiguous, and the pixels are contiguous. This is useful when
/// calling external code to process the buffers, and that external code expects input data to be contiguous.
/// Forcing the use of an input buffer is also useful when the algorithm needs to write temporary data to its input,
/// for example, to compute the median of the input data by sorting. If the input has a stride of 0 in the dimension
/// being processed (this happens when expanding singleton dimensions), it means that a single pixel is repeated across
/// the whole line. This property is preserved in the buffer. Thus, even when these two flags are used, you need to
/// check the `stride` value and deal with the singleton dimension appropriately.
///
/// The input buffer contains `bufferLength + 2 * border` pixels. The pixel pointed to by the `buffer` pointer is the
/// first pixel on that line in the input image. The `lineFilter` function object can read up to `border` pixels before
/// that pixel, and up to `border` pixels after the last pixel on the line. These pixels are filled by the framework
/// using the `boundaryCondition` value for the given dimension. The `boundaryCondition` array can be empty, in which
/// case the default boundary condition value is used. If the option \ref dip::Framework::SeparableOption::UseOutputBorder
/// is given, then the output buffer also has `border` extra samples at each end. These extra samples are meant to help
/// in the computation for some filters, and are not copied back to the output image. `position` gives the coordinates
/// for the first pixel in the buffers, subsequent pixels occur along dimension `dimension`.
/// `position[dimension]` is always zero.
///
/// If `in` and `out` share their data segments, then the input image might be overwritten with the processing result.
/// However, the input and output buffers will not share memory. That is, the line filter can freely write in the output
/// buffer without invalidating the input buffer, even when the filter is being applied in-place.
/// The \ref dip::Framework::SeparableOption::CanWorkInPlace option causes the input and output buffer to potentially
/// both point to the same image data, if input and output images are the same and everything else falls into place
/// as well. It is meant to save some copy work for those algorithms that can work in-place, but does not guarantee
/// that the output buffer points to the input data.
///
/// If `in` and `out` share their data segments (e.g. they are the same image), then the filtering operation can be
/// applied completely in place, without any temporary images. For this to be possible, `outImageType`, `bufferType`
/// and the input image data type must all be the same.
///
/// `dip::Framework::Separable` will process the image using multiple threads, so `lineFilter` will be called from
