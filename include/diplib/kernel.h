/// \brief Represents the shape and size of a filtering kernel.
///
/// Some image filters allow the specification of arbitrary kernels: the user can specify the shape
/// name and the size of a pre-defined kernel, or the user can pass an image containing the kernel.
///
/// Objects of type `dip::Image`, `dip::FloatArray` and `dip::String` implicitly convert to
/// a `%dip::Kernel`, so it should be convenient to use these various representations in your
/// code.
///
/// To define a kernel by shape and size, pass a string defining the shape, and a floating-point
/// array with the size along each dimension.
/// These are the valid shape strings:
///
/// - `"elliptic"`: The unit circle in Euclidean (\f$L^2\f$) metric.
///
/// - `"rectangular"`: A box, the unit circle in \f$L^1\f$ metric.
///
/// - `"diamond"`: A box rotated 45 degrees, the unit circle in \f$L^\infty\f$ metric (max-norm).
///
/// - `"line"`: A one-pixel thick straight line.
///
/// In the first three of these cases, the `size` array indicates the diameter of the circle. The value can
/// be different along each dimension, simply stretching the shape. Note that the sizes are not
/// necessarily odd, and don't even need to be integers. Pixels included in the neighborhood are
/// those covered by the circle, with the origin on a pixel. In the case of the rectangle, however,
/// the box is shifted by half a pixel if `floor(size)` is even. This means that the rectangular
/// kernel is not necessarily symmetric. Set the `size` to odd values to ensure symmetry. Any
/// size that is smaller or equal to 1 causes the kernel to not have an extent along that dimension.
///
/// For the case of the `"line"` kernel, the `size` array gives the size of the bounding box (rounded to
/// the nearest integer), as well as the direction of the line. A negative value for one dimension means
/// that the line runs from high to low along that dimension. The line will always run from one corner of
/// the bounding box to the opposite corner, and run through the origin.
///
/// To define a kernel through an image, provide a binary image. The "on" or "true" pixels form
/// the kernel. Note that, for most filters, the image is directly used as neighborhood (i.e. no
/// mirroring is applied). As elsewhere, the origin of the kernel is in the middle of the image,
/// and on the pixel to the right of the center in case of an even-sized image. If the image
/// is a grey-value image, then all pixels with a finite value form the kernel. The kernel then
/// has the given weights associated to each pixel.
///
