///     try {

///     }
///     catch( dip::Error& e ) {

/// When compiling with the CMake configuration flag `DIP_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE` set to `OFF`, these macros don't do
/// anything. Turn the option off if your application would make no use of the stack trace, as building the stack
/// trace does incur some runtime cost.

/// NOTE! `DIP_START_STACK_TRACE` starts a try/catch block, which must be closed with `#DIP_END_STACK_TRACE` to
/// prevent malformed syntax. Thus you should never use one of these two macros without the other one.

///
/// ```cpp
///     DIP_STACK_TRACE_THIS( dip::FunctionCall() );
