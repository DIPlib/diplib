/// \def DIP_EXPORT
/// \brief Indicates that the function or class is exported from the shared/dynamic-load library.

/// \def DIP_NO_EXPORT
/// \brief Indicates that the function or class is not exported from the shared/dynamic-load library.

/// \def DIP_CLASS_EXPORT
/// \brief Specifically for classes in a inheritance hierarchy and that must be passed across the
/// executable/shared library interface.
///
/// Equal to `DIP_NO_EXPORT` on Windows and `DIP_EXPORT` elsewhere.
///
/// On Linux and other Unix-like systems, classes in a hierarchy, as well as classes thrown as
/// exceptions, must be exported from the shared library if they are to be used across the interface
/// between the library and whatever is using the library. This is the only way that the run-time
/// linker is able to merge the virtual function tables, and identify the type of the thrown object.
///
/// However, on Windows, trying to export a class derived from a class in the standard library (such
/// as `std::exception`), or trying to export a class that contains members of a non-exported class
/// (such as a \ref dip::String, a.k.a. `std::string`), causes compiler warnings. It seems that currently
/// it is considered best practice to not export such classes. The Windows run-time linker always
/// maps local classes to those in the shared library, even when they are not exported.

/// \macro DIP_NODISCARD
/// \brief If your compiler supports it, adds `[[nodiscard]]` to a function definition.
///
/// `[[nodiscard]]` will produce a compile-time warning if the function return value is discarded.
/// This should pick up some programming errors, especially in cases where a different overload is
/// picked by the compiler than expected by the programmer. For example:
/// ```cpp
/// dip::Mean( in, {}, out ); // OK, picks main function
/// out = dip::Mean( in );    // OK, picks alternate overload
/// dip::Mean( in, out );     // warns, picks alternate overload and output is discarded
/// ```
/// The third line will warn because the compiler picks the `dip::Mean( in, mask )` overload that returns the
/// result image, rather than the intended main function `dip::Mean( in, mask, out )` that puts the result in
/// the existing `out` image.
