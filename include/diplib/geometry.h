/// \section interpolation_methods Interpolation methods
///
/// Many of the functions in this group resample the image using an interpolation method. They all perform
/// interpolation separately (i.e. along one dimension at the time). These functions have an input argument
/// called `interpolationMethod`, which determines how image data are interpolated. It can be set to one of
/// the following strings:
///
///  - `"3-cubic"` (or `""`): Third-order cubic spline interpolation (Keys, 1981), using 4 input samples to
///    compute each output sample. This is the default method for most functions.
///
///  - `"4-cubic"`: Fourth-order cubic spline interpolation (Keys, 1981), using 6 input samples to compute
///    compute each output sample.
///
///  - `"linear"`: Linear interpolation, using 2 input samples to compute each output sample.
///
///  - `"nearest"` (or `"nn"`): Nearest neighbor interpolation, samples are simply shifted and replicated.
///
///  - `"inverse nearest"` (or `"nn2"`): Nearest neighbor interpolation, but resolves the rounding of x.5 in
///    the opposite direction that `"nearest"` does. This is useful when applying the inverse of an earlier
///    transform, to be able to obtain the original geometry back.
///
///  - `"bspline"`: A third-order cardinal B-spline is computed for all samples on an image line, which is
///    sampled anew to obtain the interpolated sample values. All input samples are used to compute all
///    output samples, but only about 10 input samples significantly influence each output value.
///
///  - `"lanczos8"`: Lanczos interpolation with *a* = 8, using 16 input samples to compute each output sample.
///    The Lanczos kernel is a sinc function windowed by a larger sinc function, where *a* is the width of
///    the larger sinc function. The kernel is normalized.
///
///  - `"lanczos6"`: Lanczos interpolation with *a* = 6, using 12 input samples to compute each output sample.
///
///  - `"lanczos4"`: Lanczos interpolation with *a* = 4, using 8 input samples to compute each output sample.
///
///  - `"lanczos3"`: Lanczos interpolation with *a* = 3, using 6 input samples to compute each output sample.
///
///  - `"lanczos2"`: Lanczos interpolation with *a* = 2, using 4 input samples to compute each output sample.
///
///  - `"ft"`: Interpolation through padding and cropping, and/or modifying the phase component of the
///    Fourier transform of the image line. Padding with zeros increases the sampling density, cropping
///    reduces the sampling density, and multiplying the phase component by \f$-j s \omega\f$ shifts
///    the image. Equivalent to interpolation with a sinc kernel. All input samples are used to compute
///    all output samples. The boundary condition is ignored, as the Fourier transform imposes a periodic
///    boundary condition.
///
/// Not all methods are available for all functions. If so, this is described in the function's documentation.
/// For operations on binary images, the interpolation method is ignored, and `"nearest"` is always used.
///
/// Interpolation methods require a boundary extension of half the number of input samples used to compute
/// each output sample. For B-spline interpolation, a boundary extension of 5 is used. For the nearest neighbor
/// and Fourier interpolation methods, no boundary extension is needed.

/// \brief Resamples an image with the given zoom factor and sub-pixel shift.
///
/// The shift is applied first, and causes part of the image to shift out of the field of view.
/// Thus, `shift` is in input pixels. `boundaryCondition` determines how the new areas are filled in.
/// See `dip::BoundaryCondition`. Note that the shift can be in fractional pixels. There is no largest
/// possible shift, but applying very large shifts is not optimized for, and will use more computation
/// and temporary memory than necessary. This is true even for the periodic boundary condition; use
/// `dip::Wrap` to apply the integer shift with periodic boundary condition, then use `%Resampling` for
/// the remaining sub-pixel shift. The exception is the `"ft"` interpolation method, which uses the same
/// memory and time for large as for small shifts.
///
/// The scaling is applied next. If `zoom` is larger than 1, the output image will be larger than
/// the input, if it is smaller than 1, it will be smaller. The output image has size
/// `std::floor( in.Sizes( ii ) * zoom[ ii ] )` along dimension `ii`. For the `"ft"` method, the zoom
/// factor is back-computed from this output image size, whereas for the other methods the `zoom` is used
/// as given. This stems from the very different approach to interpolation.
///
/// The pixel at coordinates `pos` in the output image is interpolated from the position
/// `pos[ ii ] / zoom[ ii ] - shift[ ii ]` along dimension `ii`. Thus, with `zoom` smaller
/// than 1, no low-pass filtering is applied first. Again, the `"ft"` interpolation method is different:
/// the output image is generated by inverse Fourier transform from the manipulated frequency spectrum
/// of the input image. The `"ft"` method thus has low-pass filtering built-in when zooming out.
///
/// The output image has the same data type as the input image.
///
/// See \ref interpolation_methods for information on the `interpolationMethod` parameter.
