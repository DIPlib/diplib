/// \brief Adds noise to the binary input image.
///
/// The noise added to the binary image is described by the two probabilities `p10` and `p01`. `p10` is the
/// probability that a foreground pixel transitions to background (probability of 1 &rarr; 0 transition), and `p01`
/// is the probability that a background pixel transitions to foreground (probability to 0 &rarr; 1 transition).
/// Thus, `p10` indicates the probability for each foreground pixel in the input image to be set to background,
/// and `p01` indicates the probability that a background pixel in the input image is set to foreground. It is
/// possible to set either of these to 0, to limit the noise to only one of the phases: for example,
/// `BinaryNoise( in, random, 0.05, 0.0 )` limits the noise to the foreground components, and does not add noise to
/// the background.
///
/// Note that the noise generated corresponds to a Poisson point process. The distances between changed pixels
/// have a Poisson distribution. For example, the following bit of code yields a Poisson process with a density
/// governed by `D`.
///
/// ```cpp
///     dip::Random random;
///     dip::dfloat D = 0.001;
///     dip::Image poissonPoint( { 256, 256 }, 1, dip::DT_BIN );
///     poissonPoint.Fill( 0 );
///     BinaryNoise( poissonPoint, poissonPoint, random, 0, D );
/// ```
///
/// The binary noise added to an all-zero image as in the code snippet above is equivalent to thresholding
/// uniformly-distributed noise at a fraction `D` of the noise range, from the max value:
///
/// ```cpp
///     dip::Image poissonPoint2( { 256, 256 }, 1, dip::DT_SFLOAT );
///     poissonPoint2.Fill( 0 );
///     UniformNoise( poissonPoint2, poissonPoint2, random, 0, 1 );
///     poissonPoint2 = poissonPoint2 >= ( 1 - D );
/// ```
///
/// Using blue noise it is possible to create a point process with similar density, but more equally-distributed
/// points:
///
/// ```cpp
///     dip::Image poissonPoint3( { 256, 256 }, 1, dip::DT_SFLOAT );
///     FillColoredNoise( poissonPoint3, random, 1, 1 );
///     dip::dfloat threshold = Percentile( poissonPoint3, {}, 100 * ( 1 - D )).As< dip::dfloat >();

/// - 1.0: blue noise, with a frequency spectrum proportional to \$f\$.
