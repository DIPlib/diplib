///       \ref dip::FTEllipsoid, depending on the generation method. In the case of `"gaussian"` (spatial-domain
///       generation), the shape must be isotropic (have same sizes in all dimensions). In the case of `"fourier"`,
///       the image cannot have more than three dimensions.
///     - `"box"` or `"box shell"`: the shape is drawn with \ref dip::DrawBandlimitedBox or
///       \ref dip::FTBox, depending on the generation method.
///     - `"custom"`: `out` already contains a shape, which is used as-is. In the case that `params.generationMethod`
///       is `"gaussian"`, `out` is taken to be in the spatial domain, and in the case of `"fourier"`, in the
///       frequency domain.
/// - `params.objectSizes` determines the extent of the object along each dimension. Must have either one element
///   or as many elements as image dimensions in `out`.
/// - `params.objectAmplitude` determines the brightness of the object.
/// - `params.randomShift`, if `true`, shifts the object with a random sub-pixel shift in the range [-0.5,0.5].
///   This sub-pixel shift can be used to avoid bias due to digitization error over a sequence of generated objects.
///
/// `params` also describes what effects are applied to the image:
///
/// Modulation is an additive sine wave along each dimension, and is controlled by:
///
/// - `params.modulationDepth` controls the strength of the modulation. If this value is zero, no modulation is applied.
/// - `params.modulationFrequency` controls the frequency along each image axis. The units are number of periods per
///   pixel, and hence values below 0.5 should be given to prevent aliasing.
///
/// Blurring is controlled by:
///
/// - `params.pointSpreadFunction` determines the point spread function (PSF) used. It can be `"gaussian"` for
///    Gaussian blurring, `"incoherent"` for a 2D, in-focus, diffraction limited incoherent PSF (applied through
///    Fourier domain filtering), or `"none"` for no blurring.
/// - `params.oversampling` determines the size of the PSF. In the case of `"gaussian"`, the sigma used for blurring
///   is `0.9 * params.oversampling`. In the case of `"incoherent"`, this is the `oversampling` parameter passed to
///   \ref dip::IncoherentOTF.
///
/// Noise is controlled by:
///
/// - `params.backgroundValue` determines the background intensity added to the image. This is relevant for the
///   Poisson noise.
/// - `params.signalNoiseRatio` determines the signal to noise ratio (SNR), which we define as the average object
///   energy divided by average noise power (i.e. not in dB). If the SNR is larger than 0, a mixture of Gaussian
///   and Poisson noise is added to the whole image.
/// - `params.gaussianNoise` determines the relative amount of Gaussian noise used.
/// - `params.poissonNoise` determines the relative amount of Poisson noise used. The magnitude of these two
///   quantities is not relevant, only their relative values are. If they are equal, the requested SNR is divided
///   equally between the Gaussian and the Poisson noise.
///
/// `random` is the random number generator used for both the sub-pixel shift and the noise added to the image.
