/// \brief Represents the shape and size of a structuring element.
///
/// Many functions in the Mathematical Morphology module require a structuring element definition.
/// There are two ways to define a structuring element: the user can specify the shape name and the size
/// of a structuring element, and the user can pass an image containing the structuring element.
///
/// Objects of type `dip::Image`, `dip::FloatArray` and `dip::String` implicitly convert to
/// a `%dip::StructuringElement`, so it should be convenient to use these various representations in your
/// code.
///
/// To define a structuring element by shape and size, pass a string defining the shape, and a
/// floating-point array with the size along each dimension.
/// These are the valid shape strings, and the corresponding meaning of the size array:
///
/// -  `"rectangular"`, `"elliptic"`, and `"diamond"`: these are unit circles in different metrics. The
///    size array corresponds to the diameter in that metric. `"elliptic"` is the default shape,
///    because it is isotropic, but it also is the slowest to compute. Both `"elliptic"` and `"diamond"`
///    structuring elements always are symmetric. That is, their origin is centered on a pixel.
///    The pixels included in the shape are those at most half of the diameter away from the origin.
///    For the `"rectangular"` structuring element, a box with integer sizes is always generated,
///    but the box can be even in size also, meaning that the origin is in between pixels.
///    Any size array element that is smaller or equal to 1 causes that dimension to not be processed.
///
/// -  `"octagonal"`: an approximation to the ellipse in 2D only.
///
/// -  `"parabolic"`: the parabolic structuring element is the morphological equivalent to the Gaussian
///    kernel in linear filtering. It is separable and perfectly isotropic. The size array corresponds
///    to the scaling of the parabola (i.e. the \f$a\f$ in \f$a^{-2} x^2\f$). A value equal
///    or smaller to 0 causes that dimension to not be processed. The boundary condition is ignored
///    for operators with this structuring element, and the output image is always a floating-point type.
///
/// -  `"line"`, `"fast line"`, `"periodic line"`, `"discrete line"`, `"interpolated line"`:
///    these are straight lines, using different implementations.
///    The size array corresponds to the size of the bounding box of the line, with signs indicating
///    the direction. Thus, if the size array is `{2,2}`, the line goes right and down two pixels,
///    meaning that the line is formed by two pixels at an angle of 45 degrees down. If the size array
///    is `{-2,2}`, then the line is again two pixels, but at an angle of 135 degrees. (Note that
///    in images, angles increase clockwise from the x-axis, as the y-axis is inverted). For a description
///    of the meaning of these various line implementations, see \ref line_morphology.
///
/// To define a structuring element through an image, provide either a binary or grey-value image.
/// If the image is binary, the set pixels form the structuring element. If the image is a grey-value
/// image, those grey values are directly used as structuring element values. Set pixels to negative infinity
/// to exclude them from the structuring element (the result would be the same by setting them to
/// a value lower than the range of the input image, but the algorithm should be more efficient if
/// those pixels are excluded).
///
/// Note that the image is directly used as neighborhood (i.e. no mirroring is applied).
/// That is, `dip::Dilation` and `dip::Erosion` will use the same neighborhood. Their composition only
/// leads to an opening or a closing if the structuring element is symmetric. For non-symmetric structuring
/// element images, you need to mirror it in one of the two function calls:
///
/// ```cpp
///     dip::Image se = ...;
///     dip::Image out = dip::Erosion( in, se );
///     out = dip::Dilation( out, se.Mirror() );
/// ```
///
/// (Do note that, in the code above, `se` itself is modified! use `se.QuickCopy().Mirror()` to prevent
/// that.)
///
/// As elsewhere, the origin of the structuring element is in the middle of the image, on the pixel to
/// the right of the center in case of an even-sized image.
///
/// \see dip::Kernel, dip::PixelTable
///
/// \section line_morphology Line morphology
///
/// There are various different ways of applying dilations, erosions, openings and closings with line
/// structuring elements. The `dip::StructuringElement` class accepts five different strings each
/// providing a different definition of the line structuring element. Further, there is also the
/// `dip::PathOpening` function, which provides path openings and closings. Here we describe the five
/// different line structuring elements implemented in *DIPlib*.
///
/// - `"line"`: This is an efficient implementation that yields the same results as the traditional line
///   structuring element (`"discrete line"`). It is implemented as a combination of `"periodic line"` and
///   `"discrete line"`, and is called *recursive line* in the literature (see Soille, 1996). If the line
///   parameters are such that the periodic line has a short period, this implementation saves a lot of time.
///   In this case, for a given line angle, the cost of the operation is independent of the length of the line.
///   If the line parameters are such that the periodic line has only one point, this is identical to
///   `"discrete line"`.
///
/// - `"fast line"`: This is a faster algorithm that applies a 1D operation along Bresenham lines, yielding
///   a non-translation-invariant result. The cost of this operation is always independent of the length of the line.
///
/// - `"periodic line"`: This is a line formed of only a subset of the pixels along the Bresenham line,
///   such that it can be computed as a 1D operation along Bresenham lines, but still yields a
///   translation-invariant result (Soille, 1996). It might not be very useful on its own, but when combined
///   with the `"discrete line"`, it provides a more efficient implementation of the traditional line structuring
///   element (see `"line"` above).
///
/// - `"discrete line"`: This is the traditional line structuring element, drawn using the Bresenham algorithm
///   and applied brute-force.
///
/// - `"interpolated line"`: This operation skews the image, using interpolation, such that the line operation
///   can be applied along an image axis; the result of the operation is then skewed back. The result is an
///   operation with a line that uses interpolation to read image intensities in between pixels.
///   This greatly improves the results in e.g. a granulometry when the input image is band limited
///   (Luengo Hendriks, 2005). However, the result of morphological operations is not band limited, and so the
///   second, reverse skew operation will lose some precision. Note that the result of morphological operations
///   with this SE do not strictly satisfy the corresponding properties (only by approximation) because of the
///   interpolated values. Setting the boundary condition to `"periodic"` allows the operation to occur completely
///   in place; other boundary conditions lead to a larger intermediate image, and thus will always require
///   additional, temporary storage.
///
/// For all these lines, if they are an even number of pixels in length, then the origin is placed at the result
/// of the integer division `length/2`. That is, on the pixel that comes just after the true middle of the line.
/// This means that the line `{8,3}` will have the origin on pixel number 4 (when starting counting at 0), as will
/// the line `{-8,-3}`. The difference between these two is that the latter starts on the bottom right and goes
/// left and up, whereas the former starts on the top left and goes right and down. Note that the drawn Bresenham
/// line might have a slightly different configuration also.
///
/// The SE `"line"` is different from the others in that these two lines will be normalized to the exact same line:
/// If the first size component is negative, all size components will be negated, turning `{-8,-3}` into `{8,3}`.
/// This makes it easier to decompose the SE into the two components. Do note that, because of this normalization,
/// there could be a 1 pixel shift for even-sized lines as compared to `"discrete line"` or `"fast line"`.
///
/// A few quick experiments have shown that, depending on the angle and the direction of the line w.r.t.
/// the image storage order, `"discrete line"` can be much faster than `"line"` (or `"fast line"`) for shorter
/// lines (times were equal with around 50px length), or they can be much slower for even the shortest of lines.
/// Predicting which implementation of the line will be faster for a given situation is not trivial.

/// \brief Computes the watershed of `in` within `mask`, with on-line merging of regions.
///
/// The watershed is a segmentation algorithm that divides the image according to its grey-value
/// ridges.
///
/// `connectivity` determines which pixels are considered neighbors; the default value of 1 leads
/// to vertex-connected watershed lines (i.e. thinnest possible result). See \ref connectivity for
/// information on the connectivity parameter.
///
/// `flags` determines how the output is computed. There are three options:
/// - `"labels"` or `"binary"`: returns either the labels used during processing, with the watershed
///   lines as background (value 0), or a binary image where the watershed lines are set and the
///   regions are not set. `"binary"` is the default.
/// - `"low first"` or `"high first"`: determines the sort order of pixels. The default of `"low first"`
///   yields the normal watershed, where local minima are origin of the basins, and the watershed
///   lines run along the high ridges in the image. `"high first"` simply inverts the definition,
///   such that local maxima are at the centers of the basins, and the watershed lines run along
///   the low valleys.
/// - `"fast"` or `"correct"`: determines which algorithm is used:
///   - `"fast"` is an algorithm that takes a few shortcuts, but usually manages to produce good results
///     any way. One shortcut leads to all border pixels being marked as watershed lines. It is possible
///     to extend the image by one pixel before processing to circumvent this. The other shortcut means
///     that plateaus are not handled correctly. A plateau is a region in the image where pixels have
///     exactly the same value. This is usually seen as watershed lines not running through the middle of
///     the plateaus, instead being shifted to one side. Adding a little bit of noise to the image, and
///     setting `maxDepth` to the range of the noise, usually improves the results in these cases
///     a little bit.
///   - `"correct"` is an algorithm that first finds the local minima through `dip::Minima` (or maxima if
///     `"high first"` is set), and then applies `dip::SeededWatershed`. This always produces correct results,
///     but is significantly slower.
///
/// The on-line region merging works as follows: When two regions first meet, a decision is
/// made on whether to keep the regions separate (and thus put a watershed pixel at that point),
/// or to merge the regions. If one of the regions is no deeper than `maxDepth` (i.e. the intensity
/// difference between the region's minimum and the pixel where the region meets another), and is
/// no larger than `maxSize` (i.e. the number of pixels belonging to the region and that have been
/// seen so far), then it can be merged. The merged region is subsequently treated as a single
/// region, and their labels are considered equal. If `maxSize` is zero, no test for size is done.
/// In this case, the merging is exactly equivalent to applying an H-minima transform to the image
/// before computing the watershed.
///
/// Note that for the `"fast"` algorithm, `maxDepth` is always at least 0 (negative values will be ignored).
/// That is, two regions without a grey-value difference between them (they are on the same plateau) will
/// always be merged. This is necessary to prevent unexpected results (i.e. a plateau being split into
/// multiple regions). For the `"correct"` algorithm, any negative value of `maxDepth` will disable the
/// merging. But note that, due to the way that the region seeds are computed (`dip::Minima`), setting
/// `maxDepth` to 0 would lead to the exact same result.
///
/// Any pixel that is infinity will be part of the watershed lines, as is any pixel not within
/// `mask`.

/// an edge in the image, the values are in the range [0,`nIterations`]. The input image `in` should contain high
/// gray values at the edges of the regions to be segmented. Thresholding `out` at an appropriate value will yield
/// the relevant edges in the image. Alternatively, apply `dip::Watershed` to the result, with `maxDepth` set to
/// the appropriate threshold value.
///
/// The number of seeds used is given by `nSeeds`. Actually seeds are chosen with a density of
/// `nSeeds / in.NumberOfPixels()`, the random process causes the actual number of seeds to differ between
/// runs. Seeds are placed either through a Poisson point process (`seeds` is `"poisson"`) or a randomly
/// translated and rotated grid (`seeds` is `"rectangular"` (any number of dimensions), `"hexagonal"` (2D only),
/// or `"bcc"` or `"fcc"` (3D only)). The output contains counts, in the range [0,`nIterations`].
///
/// If `seeds` is `"exact"`, or if `nIterations` is 0, then the exact probabilities are computed
/// (Malmberg and Luengo, 2014). The output contains probabilities, in the range [0,1]. Note that this algorithm
/// requires O(n<sup>2</sup>) space, and is not suitable for very large images.
///
/// The stochastic watershed expects the image to contain roughly equally-sized regions. `nSeeds` should be
/// approximately equal to the number of expected regions. If there is a strong difference in region sizes, larger
/// regions will be split into smaller ones.
///
/// If the image contains regions with different sizes, it is recommended to set `noise` to a value that is larger
/// than the variation within regions, but smaller than the height of the barrier between regions. Uniform noise
/// will be added to the input image for every iteration of the process, causing non-significant edges to be
/// strongly suppressed (Bernander et al., 2013). In the case of the exact stochastic watershed, the
/// operation is applied three times with random noise added to the input, and the geometric mean of the results
/// is returned (Selig et al., 2015).
///
/// `in` must be real-valued and scalar. `out` will be of a suitable unsigned integer type (depending on the number
/// of iterations, but typically `dip::DT_UINT8`), or of type `dip::DT_SFLOAT` if the exact stochastic watershed
/// is computed.

/// \brief Applies a path opening or closing in a specific direction.

/// The path opening is an opening over all possible paths of a specific length and general direction. A path
/// direction represents a 90 degree cone within which paths are generated. The paths are formed by single pixel
/// steps in one of three directions (in 2D): the main direction, or 45 degrees to the left or right. That is,
/// if the main direction is [1,0] (to the right), then [1,-1] and [1,1] (diagonal up or down) are also possible
/// steps. This leads to a number of different paths that is exponential in its lengths. However, the opening over
/// all these paths can be computed in \f$O(n \log(n))\f$ time, with \f$n\f$ the path length.
///
/// The direction description above can be generalized to any number of dimensions by realizing that the main direction
/// can be specified by any of the neighbors of a central pixel, and then the other allowed steps are the neighbor
/// pixels that are also neighbor to the pixel that represents the main direction. In 3D, this leads to 6 or 8 alternate
/// steps.
///
/// There are 4 possible path directions in 2D, and 13 in 3D. Both length and direction are specified through
/// the `filterParam` argument, see below. Note that the path length is given by the number of pixels in the path,
/// not the Euclidean length of the path.
///
/// The `polarity` parameter can be `"opening"` (the default) or `"closing"`, to compute the path opening and path
/// closing, respectively.
///
/// When `mode` contains `"constrained"`, the path construction described above is modified such that, after every alternate
/// step, a step in the main direction must be taken. This constraint avoids a zig-zag line that causes the path
/// opening to yield much shorter lines for the diagonal directions if the lines in the image are thicker than one pixel.
/// See the paper by Luengo referenced below. It also reduces the cone size from 90 degrees to 45 degrees, making the
/// algorithm more directionally-selective. The constrained mode increases computation time a little, but is highly
/// recommended when using the path opening in a granulometry. The alternate flag is `"unconstrained"`, which is the
/// default and does not need to be given.
///
/// Path openings can be sensitive to noise. If `mode` contains `"robust"`, a robust path opening or closing is
/// obtained. A robust path opening is computed by dilating the image with a 2x2 rectangular structuring element,
/// applying the path opening, then taking the infimum of the result and the input (Merveille, 2018). For a path
/// closing, the erosion and the supremum are used instead.
///
/// \par Definition of `filterSize`
/// `length = max(abs(filterSize))` is the number of pixels in the line.
/// The path direction is determined by translating `filterSize` to an array with -1, 0 and 1 values using
/// `direction = round(filterSize/length)`. For example, if `filterSize=[7,0]`, then `length` is 7, and
/// `direction` is `[1,0]` (to the right), with `[1,1]` and `[1,-1]` as alternate directions.
