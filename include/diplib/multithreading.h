/// to be done is large enough to compensate for the overhead of spawning threads.

/// at a higher level, for example by processing multiple images at the same time. If you do so, set `nThreads` to 1.
/// Furthermore, it seems that calling multithreaded *DIPlib* functions from within an OpenMP parallel section
/// doesn't work, so within an OpenMP parallel section you should always set `nThreads` to 1.
///
/// If `nThreads` is 0, resets the maximum number of threads to the default value.

/// Note that this number is thread-local, meaning it only applies to the current thread from which this
