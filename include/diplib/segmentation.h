/// \brief Detect edges in the grey-value image by finding salient ridges in the gradient magnitude

/// edges in the image. The gradient magnitude (see `dip::GradientMagnitude`) is computed using
/// Gaussian derivatives, with a sigma of `sigma`. The found ridges are pruned to remove the less
/// salient edges (see `dip::NonMaximumSuppression`). Next, a threshold `t1` is computed such that
/// the `1 - upper` fraction of pixels with the highest gradient magnitude are kept. A second threshold,
/// `t2 = t1 * lower`, is selected that determines the minimal gradient magnitude expected for an edge.
/// All edge pixels equal or larger to `t2`, and are in the same connected region as at least one pixel that
/// is equal or larger to `t1`, are selected as the output of this function (see `dip::HysteresisThreshold`).
/// Finally, a homotopic thinning is applied to reduce the detections to single-pixel--thick lines
/// (see `dip::EuclideanSkeleton`).
///
/// The `1 - upper` fraction is computed over all pixels in the image by default. If the image has relatively
/// few edges, this can lead to `t1` being equal to 0. If this happens, the hysteresis threshold would select
/// all pixels in the image, and the homotopic thinning will lead to a line across the image that is
/// unrelated to any edges. Instead, `t1` will be set to a value slightly larger than 0.
///
/// For more control over the thresholds, the `selection` parameter can be set to `"nonzero"`, in which
/// case the fraction `1 - upper` refers to non-zero pixels only; or to `"absolute"`, in which case
/// `upper` and `lower` represent absolute threshold values, and `t1` will be set to `upper` and `t2`
/// will be set to `lower`.
