/// \brief The Kuwahara-Nagao operator, a non-linear edge-preserving smoothing filter.
///
/// For each pixel, shifts the filtering window such that the variance within the window is minimal, then
/// computes the average value as the output. The shift of the window is always such that the pixel under
/// consideration stays within the window.
///
/// In the two original papers describing the method (Kuwahara et al., 1980; Nagao and Matsuyama, 1979), a limited
/// number of sub-windows within the filtering window were examined (4 and 8, respectively). This function implements
/// a generalized version that allows as many different shifts are pixels are in the filtering window (Bakker et al.,
/// 1999).
///
/// As described by Bakker (2002), this operator produces artificial boundaries in flat regions. This is because,
/// due to noise, one position of the filtering window will have the lowest variance in its neighborhood, and therefore
/// that position will be selected for all output pixels in the neighborhood. The solution we implement here is
/// requiring that the variance at the minimum be lower than the variance when the window is not shifted. The parameter
/// `threshold` controls how much lower the minimum must be. If the neighborhood is uniform w.r.t. this threhsold
/// parameter, then the filtering window is not shifted.
///
/// The size and shape of the filter window is given by `kernel`, which you can define through a default
/// shape with corresponding sizes, or through a binary image. See `dip::Kernel`.
///
/// If `in` is non-scalar (e.g. a color image), then the variance is computed per-channel, and the maximum variance
/// at each pixel (i.e. the maximum across tensor elements) is used to direct the filtering for all channels.
/// If the Kuwahara filter were applied to each channel independently, false colors would appear.
