/// \file
/// \brief This is the main include file for the *DIPlib* library.
///
/// This header file is the core of *DIPlib*. It declares all classes, functions,
/// macros and constants that form the basic library infrastructure. It does so
/// by including all the header files in the \link_to_include_diplib_library directory.
/// Everything is declared within the `#dip` namespace.
///
/// To access image processing or analysis functionality, include their
/// corresponding header files.

/// \brief The `dip` namespace contains all the library functionality.
namespace dip {

/// \defgroup infrastructure The library infrastructure
/// \brief The nuts and bolts that make it all work
/// \{

/// \brief Holds information about the *DIPlib* binary.
///
/// Information in this structure can be used to display library information
/// to the user (e.g. in a splash screen). It also contains information that
/// can be used to determine at run time the properties of the DIPlib library
/// that the application links to. Refer to `dip::libraryInformation`.
///
/// The string `type` starts either with "Release" or "Debug", indicating
/// the whether the library was compiled with optimizations enabled and no
/// debug information (release) or without optimizations and with debug
/// information (debug). Next it lists a series of compile-time options,
/// separated by comma. The options are:
///  - "with OpenMP": indicates multithreading is built in.
///  - "recording stack traces": indicates that exceptions report a stack trace,
///    rather than only show the function that threw it.
///  - "asserts enabled": indicates additional run-time tests for consistency
///    are executed.
///  - "Unicode support": indicates e.g. units are output using Unicode.
///  - "ICS support": indicates ICS file reading and writing is available.
///  - "TIFF support": indicates TIFF file reading and writing is available.
///  - "JPEG support": indicates JPEG file reading and writing is available.
