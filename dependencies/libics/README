          Image Cytometry Standard file reading and writing.

This is the reference library for ICS (Image Cytometry Standard), an
open standard for writing images of any dimensionality and data type to
file, together with associated information regarding the recording
equipment or recorded subject.

   ICS version 1.0 and 2.0
=============================

ICS stands for Image Cytometry Standard, and was first proposed in:
     P. Dean, L. Mascio, D. Ow, D. Sudar, J. Mullikin, "Propsed
     standard for image cytometry data files", Cytometry, n.11,
     pp.561-569, 1990.

It writes 2 files, one is the header, with an '.ics' extension, and the
other is the actual image data (with an '.ids' extension.)

ICS version 2.0 extends this standard to allow for a more versatile
placement of the image data. It can now be placed either in the same
'.ics' file or inbedded in any other file, by specifying the file name
and the byte offset for the data.

The advantage of ICS over other open standards such as TIFF is that it
allows data of any type and dimensionality to be stored. A TIFF file
can contain a collection of 2D images; it's up to the user to determine
how these relate to each other. An ICS file can contain, for exmaple, a
5D image in which the 4th dimension is the light frequency and the 5th
time. Also, all of the information regarding the microscope settings
(or whatever instument was used to acquire the image) and the sample
preparation can be included in the file.

   Documentation
==============================

   Online documentation can be found at: https://svi-opensource.github.io/libics

   Installation Instructions
===============================

Obtain the source distribution from
   https://github.com/svi-opensource/libics
It is recommended you also install zlib (http://www.zlib.org).

 - Compilation under UNIX / Linux / Mac OS X / Cygwin

Run the following commands from the source directory:
   ./configure
   make
   make install
Read the INSTALL file for more information.

The library can be tested for problems using
   make check

 - Compilation under Windows with Borland C++

Edit the paths defined at the beginning of Makefile.bcc, then type
   make -f Makefile.bcc
from a command prompt in the source directory. This will create a file
libics.lib in the same directory. To build a dynamic library (DLL), type
   make -f Makefile.bcc dynamic
The dynamic library libics.dll has an import library named
libics.dll.lib. To make a debug version add '-DDEBUG' to these commands.
To disable zlib support, remove the definition of ZLIB_SUPPORT from the
file Makefile.bcc.
When compiling a program that uses the dynamic library, you need to
define the USE_ICSLIB_DLL pre-processor variable.

 - Compilation under Windows with Microsoft Visual C++ 9

Edit the path to Zlib defined at the beginning of Makefile.vc9, then
type
   nmake /f Makefile.vc9
from a command prompt in the source directory. This will create a
dynamic library libics.dll in the same directory, and an import library
libics.lib. Change the definitions of SHARED or DEBUG in the makefile to
create static and/or debug versions of the library. To disable zlib
support, remove the definition of ZLIB_SUPPORT from the makefile.
When compiling a program that uses the dynamic library, you need to
define the USE_ICSLIB_DLL pre-processor variable.

 - Compilation under Windows with older versions of Microsoft Visual C++

Edit the paths defined at the beginning of Makefile.vc6, then type
   nmake /f Makefile.vc6
from a command prompt in the source directory. This will create a file
libics.lib in the same directory. To build a dynamic library, type
   nmake /f Makefile.vc6 dynamic
The dynamic library libics.dll has an import library named
libics.dll.lib. To make a debug version add '/D DEBUG' to these
commands. To disable zlib support, remove the definition of ZLIB_SUPPORT
from the file Makefile.vc.

 - Compilation with CMake under UNIX / Linux / Mac OS X / Cygwin

Run the following commands from outside the source directory
   cmake <path/to/libics/sources>
   make
   make install

The library can be tested for problems using
   make test

CMake can be used with the following options:
   cmake ... -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug # build a debug version
   cmake ... -DLIBICS_USE_ZLIB=Off    # do not use zlib
   cmake ... -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=On   # build a shared library
   cmake ... -DLIBICS_INCLUDE_CPP=Off # do not include the C++ interface

CMake projects using libics as a subproject can do
   add_subdirectory(<path/to/libics/sources>)
   target_link_libraries(target PRIVATE libics)
The include directory for libics will be automatically set, and the zlib
library will be linked if necessary.

 - Compilation with cmake on Windows:

Type on the command line
   cmake CMakeLists.txt
or use cmake GUI. Next, open sln file in Visual Studio and build solution.

   The documentation still carries the version number 1.5.

version 1.5.1
   Added functionality:
   - IcsGetDataWithStrides() makes it easy to read in an ICS file into
     a non-contiguous memory block such as an ROI, or to have different

version 1.4.1
   Added functionality:
   - Replaced config files with autoconf scripts.
   Changes / improvements / fixes:
   - The MAXPATHLEN define is replaced by a custom ICS_MAXPATHLEN. This

   - Moved web stuff to SourceForge.net.
   - Changed the presentation page of the website a bit.
   The documentation still carries the version number 1.4.

version 1.4
   Added functionality:
   - IcsSetDataWithStrides() allows writing data that is not stored in
     the default x-y-z order, as well as a ROI in a larger image.
   - IcsOpen() now also has a mode "rf" which avoids adding the ".ics"
     extension to the given file name.
   Changes / improvements / fixes:
   - IcsVersion(), IcsReadIcs() and IcsGetIcsName() have an extra
     parameter that indicates whether to add the extension to the given
     file name or not.
   - IcsInit() is now declared as a void function.
   - The ICS structure has a new element: DataStrides.
   - The file libics_compress.non.ansi.c is no longer.

   - Allowing for axes scaling to be <= 0.
   - Bugfix: small values are also written in scientific notation.
   - Creation of DLL added to Windows Makefiles.

version 1.3 (Most changes by Bert Gijsbers)
   Added functionality:
   - Added PinholeSpacing to sensor parameters.
   - IcsExtensionFind() finds extensions including .ids.Z and .ids.gz.
   - IcsGetSensor and IcsSetSensor functions to get and set the sensor
     parameters.
   - IcsGetErrorText() returns string representation of error.
   Changes / improvements / fixes:
   - IcsGetIcsName() and IcsGetIdsName() now preserve the case in the
     extension.
   - 'struct _ICS' is now defined besides the 'ICS' typedef.
   - IcsPrintIcs() would loop forever with non-zero sensor channels.
   - Some %d format strings were called with a long int argument.
   - Dimension types are now always size_t instead of int.
   - Big improvements in the IcsViewer utility (by Frank de Jong).

version 1.2.1
   A few small bug fixes:
   - 12 bytes got lost because a free() call was missing.
   - Reading a compressed file in blocks caused a SGV if the last imel
     was included in the block (because of the CRC).
   - support/icsviewer now adds some padding to each image line so that
     Windows correctly displays the image.
   The documentation still carries the version number 1.2.

version 1.2
   Added functions:
   - IcsGetROIData(), and the more general IcsGetDataBlock(),
     IcsSkipDataBlock(). These funcions make it possible to read in
     only a portion of the image data.
   - IcsGetPreviewData() reads in a 2D sub-image, and converts it to
     unsinged 8-bit integers for display.
   - IcsLoadPreview() does the same, but just takes a file name. It
     allocates the image buffer for you.
   Changes / improvements / fixes:
   - Many "unsigned int" parameters have been changed to "size_t". This
     improves portability to 64-bit systems (and fixes some bugs too).
   - Added return error codes to the documentation, as well as some
     other interesting information.
   - Corrected some bugs in the documentation.
   - Added 'extern "C" {}' to the public header files so libics can be
     used with C++.

version 1.1
   Some improvements:
   - Added support for the 'SCIL_TYPE' parameter (thanks to Fons Laan).
     Call IcsSetScilType() or IcsGuessScilType() to write the parameter
     to the ICS file.
   - Any character is now allowed as a line separator, as specified in
     the standard.
   - ICS files with CR/LF pairs instead of CR characters only are now
     also supported. The CR/LF pair problem is caused by some windows
     applications that automatically convert 'text' files to the MS-DOS
     format. These were not read by libics.
   - Some low-level library functions have been renamed to make the
     interface more consistent:
     IcsRead()   -> IcsReadIcs()
     IcsWrite()  -> IcsWriteIcs()
     IdsRead()   -> IcsReadIds()
     IdsWrite()  -> IcsWriteIds()
   - The documentation has been updated and corrected.

version 1.0
   Initial release.
