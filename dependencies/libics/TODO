libics to do list
-----------------

- Add bzip2 support, or rather xz (through XZ Utils).

- 1-bit-per-pixel data should be packed when written. Ics_DataType
  should then add a Ics_uint1 or Ics_binary data type. Tomás Majtner
  submitted some code that gets us pretty close to this.

- IcsGetPreviewData() should look for dimensions labelled "x" and "y".
  If one of them is not present, use first available dimension instead.
  Read the data using IcsGetROIData(). Make sure the planes are counted
  over the dimensions that are not considered "x" and "y".

- The MATLAB MEX-files ICSREAD should also look for dimensions labelled
  "x", "y", "z", "t" or "time" and "probe". Reorder so "probe" is at the
  end, and x, y, z, t are in that order at the beginning.

- Make a function IcsGetROIDataWithStrides(). IcsGetROIData() and
  IcsGetDataWithStrides() should be direct calls to this function
  with some NULL pointers. Maybe even macros?

- IrfanView plugin should be updated, it still has a 3 year old bug.

- test_ics2a shows an issue with endianness and the ICS file pointing to
  an existing data file: we have no good way of determining the endianness
  of this data file, and are stuck with using the machine's endinanness.
