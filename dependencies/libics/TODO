libics to do list
-----------------

- Add bzip2 support, or rather xz (through XZ Utils).

- 1-bit-per-pixel data should be packed when written. Ics_DataType
  should then add a Ics_uint1 or Ics_binary data type. Tom√°s Majtner
  submitted some code that gets us pretty close to this.

- IcsGetPreviewData() should look for dimensions labelled "x" and "y".
  If one of them is not present, use first available dimension instead.
  Read the data using IcsGetROIData(). Make sure the planes are counted
  over the dimensions that are not considered "x" and "y".

- The MATLAB MEX-files ICSREAD should also look for dimensions labelled
  "x", "y", "z", "t" or "time" and "probe". Reorder so "probe" is at the
  end, and x, y, z, t are in that order at the beginning.

- Make a function IcsGetROIDataWithStrides(). IcsGetROIData() and
  IcsGetDataWithStrides() should be direct calls to this function
  with some NULL pointers. Maybe even macros?

- IrfanView plugin should be updated, it still has a 3 year old bug.
