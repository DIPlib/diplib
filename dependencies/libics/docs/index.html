    <span class="subtitle">Image Cytometry Standard file reading and writing.</span></h1>

    <p>This is the reference library for ICS (Image Cytometry Standard), an
    open standard for writing images of any dimensionality and data type to
    file, together with associated information regarding the recording
    equipment or recorded subject.</p>

    <h2><a name="description"></a>ICS version 1.0 and 2.0</h2>

    <p>ICS stands for Image Cytometry Standard, and was first proposed in:</p>
    <p class="indented">P. Dean, L. Mascio, D. Ow, D. Sudar, J. Mullikin,
    "Proposed standard for image cytometry data files", Cytometry, n.11,
    pp.561-569, 1990.
    <span class="download"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cyto.990110502">[DOI]</a></span>
    <span class="download"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=2379446">[PubMed]</a></span>
    </p>

    <p>It writes 2 files, one is the header, with an <tt>'.ics'</tt>
    extension, and the other is the actual image data (with an
    <tt>'.ids'</tt> extension).</p>

    <p>ICS version 2.0 extends this standard to allow for a more versatile
    placement of the image data. It can now be placed either in the same
    <tt>'.ics'</tt> file or embedded in any other file, by
    specifying the file name and the byte offset for the data.</p>

    <p>The advantage of ICS over other open standards such as TIFF is that it
    allows data of any type and dimensionality to be stored. A TIFF file
    can contain a collection of 2D images; it's up to the user to determine
    how these relate to each other. An ICS file can contain, for example, a
    5D image in which the 4th dimension is the light frequency and the 5th
    time. Also, all of the information regarding the microscope settings
    (or whatever instrument was used to acquire the image) and the sample
    preparation can be included in the file.</p>
