"The fastest feature-rich C++11 single-header testing framework for unit tests and TDD"

We use doctest for unit tests throughout the DIPlib library. If you want to use doctest in
your own code, and not re-test DIPlib at the same time, do not define the DIP__ENABLE_DOCTEST
preprocessor macro. That will disable the inclusion of doctest.h and all tests in all DIPlib
library headers.
