\page sec_dum_gettingstarted Getting Started

To show you around *DIPimage*, we will work through a simple
image analysis application. Not all steps will be written out
explicitly, since it is our goal to make you understand what is going
on, and not to have you copy some commands and stare in amazement at the
result.

The goal of this application is to do some measurements on an image of
some rice grains, then analyze these measurements.

\section sec_dum_gettingstarted_gui Starting the GUI

Type the following command at the *MATLAB* prompt:

```matlab
dipimage
```

This should start the *DIPimage* GUI. A new window appears to the top-left
of the screen, which contains a menu bar. Spend some time exploring the
menus. When you choose one of the options, the area beneath the menu bar
should change into a dialog box that allows you to enter the parameters
for the filter you have chosen. See also
\ref sec_dum_functions_dipimage and \ref sec_dum_customizing_gui for more info on the GUI.

\section sec_dum_gettingstarted_loading Loading and displaying an image

Before you can use these functions, you first need to load some image.
The first menu is called "File I/O", and its first item "Read image
(readim)". Select it. Press the "Browse" button, and choose the file
`rice.tif`. Change the name for the output variable from `ans` to `a`,
then press the "Execute" button. Two things should happen:

1.  The image 'rice' is loaded into the variable `a`, and displayed to
    a figure window:

    ![Rice image displayed in figure window](rice.png)

2.  The following lines (or something very similar) appear in the
    command window:

```matlabsession
>> a = readim('c:\dip\share\images\rice.tif','')
Displayed in figure 1
```

This is to show you that the same would have happened if you would have
typed that command directly yourself, without using the GUI. Try typing
this command:

```matlab
a = readim('rice')
```

The same image should be loaded into the same variable, and again
displayed to a window. Note that we left off the `'.tif'` ending of
the filename. `readim` can find the file without you having to specify
the extension. We also didn't use the second argument to the `readim`
function, since `''` is the default value. Finally, by not specifying a
path to the file, we asked the function to look for it either in the
current directory or in any of the directories specified by the
`ImageFilePath` setting (see \ref sec_dum_customizing_dippref).

To avoid having the image displayed in a window automatically, add a
semicolon to the end of the command:

```matlab
a = readim('rice');
```

\section sec_dum_gettingstarted_preprocessing Pre-processing the image

You will have noticed the heavy background shading in this image. If we
try to segment it directly, the results will be unsatisfactory (as you
can try out later). Let's do some background correction. The idea is to
use a low-pass filter that removes the objects while keeping the slow
change in the background. Choose "Filters" and "Gaussian filter". Select
`a` as the input image, and choose a name for your background image (we
use `bg`). Finally, choose a suitable value for the "Sigma" parameter,
such that the objects are removed and the background shading is left.
Try different settings until you are satisfied with the result.

Once we have the background image, we can subtract it from the original
image. It is very easy to do arithmetic with images in *MATLAB*. Type

```matlab
a = a - bg
```

The new image should be displayed to a figure window, but it looks very
dark. This is because the pixels have lower values now, some even have
negative values. By default, images are displayed by mapping the value 0
to black, and the value 255 to white. You can change this by choosing a
different mapping mode. Open the "Mappings" menu on the figure window,
and choose "Linear stretch" (try out the other modes too).

![rice minus background](rice_min_bg.png)

The "Actions" menu allows you to choose what the mouse should do on the
figure window. Select "Pixel testing", and press the mouse button while
pointing somewhere in the image (keep the button down). The figure
caption changes to show the coordinates of the mouse in the image and
the value of the pixel at those coordinates. Try moving the mouse while
holding the button down. Another option on the "Actions" menu ("Zoom")
is used to zoom in on an image. Try it out too. See
\ref sec_dum_figurewindows for more information on the figure
windows.

The next step is to segment the image. We need to find some threshold
that distinguishes the grains of rice from the background. To find it,
we can examine the histogram of the image. Choose "Histogram" on the
"Statistics" menu, or type

```matlab
diphist(a,[])
```

The graph shows two peaks, one for the background, one for the objects.
Find a value in between for the threshold. To do the segmentation,
compare all pixel values with the threshold, which can be done in this
way:

```matlab
b = a > 20
```

This results in a binary image (logical image, containing values of
"true" and "false", coded as 1 and 0), with ones at the pixels that
belong to the objects. This image is displayed in red and black to
emphasize that it is a binary image rather than a grey-value image with
only two different grey values. Binary images have different
characteristics than grey-value images, for example they can be used to
index into other images, just like *MATLAB*'s logical arrays.

The final step is to remove the grains that do not completely lie inside
the image. We can do this using a binary operation. Find and execute the
"Remove edge objects" function in the menu system. What it does is the
same as the `bpropagation` function, with an empty image as a seed
image, and the edge condition set to 1. To create an empty seed image
use the `newim` function. Thus, these two commands are equivalent:

```matlab
b = b - bpropagation(newim(b,'bin'),b,0,2,1)
b = brmedgeobjs(b,2)
```

\section sec_dum_gettingstarted_measuring Measuring

Before we can start measuring, it is convenient to have a label image.
Select the "Label objects" item on the "Segmentation" menu, and select
the new object image as the input. The result (name the image `lab`) is
a labeled image where the pixels belonging to each object have a
different value. In the window of the new image, select the "Labels"
mapping. Now each grey value gets a different color. Examine the pixel
values to see how the objects are labeled.

![Labeled rice image](rice_labels.png)

Now do the measuring. We will measure the object area in pixels
(`'Size'`) and the Feret diameters (`'Feret'`), which are the largest
and smallest diameters, and the diameter perpendicular to the smallest
diameter.

```matlab
data = measure(lab,[],{'Size','Feret'});
```

`measure` returns an object of type `dip_measurement`, which is
explained further in \ref sec_dum_dip_measurement. Leaving the
semi-colon off the previous command, the complete measurement results
are displayed at the command prompt. Furthermore, `data(1)` is the
measurement results for object with label 1, `data.Feret` is an array
containing all the Feret diameters, and `data(1).Feret` are the Feret
diameters for object number 1.

To extract the measurements done on all objects and put them in an
array, type

```matlab
feret = data.Feret;
sz = data.Size;
```

This gives us arrays with the measured data. *MATLAB* allows all kinds of
statistics and analysis on these arrays. For example, `mean(sz)` gives
the mean grain area.

We will use `scatter` to find some correlation between the diameters and
the area of the grains. Let's start by plotting the length of the grains
against their width:

```matlab
figure;
scatter(feret(:,1),feret(:,2))
```

Apparently, they are mostly unrelated. Let's try a relation between the
length and the surface area:

```matlab
scatter(feret(:,1),sz)
```

These appear to be more related, but, of course, the area also depends
on the width of the grains. If we assume that the grains are elliptic,
we know that the area is $\frac{1}{4}\pi d_1 d_2$. Let's plot the
calculated area against the measured area:

```matlab
calc = pi/4 * feret(:,1) .* feret(:,2);
scatter(sz,calc)
```

Wow! That is a linear relation. We can add a line along the diagonal to
see how much the ratio differs from 1 (the other commands are to make
the figure look prettier):

```matlab
hold on
plot([180,360],[180,360],'k--')
axis equal
box on
xlabel('object area   (pixels^2)')
ylabel('\pi{\cdot}a{\cdot}b   (pixels^2)')
```

![Graph produced by code above](rice_graph.png)

The actual slope can be computed by:

```matlab
f = sz\calc
```

(this is the lest-squares solution to the linear equation `sz*f = calc`).

\section sec_dum_gettingstarted_where_to_go Where to go from here

If you are new to *MATLAB*, it would be a good idea to read the "Getting
Started with *MATLAB*" manual. If you are new to image processing, you can
read ["The Fundamentals of Image Processing"](ftp://qiftp.tudelft.nl/DIPimage/docs/FIP2.3.pdf).

Before you start using this toolbox, we recommend that you read
\ref "sec_dum_dip_image" (at least \ref sec_dum_dip_image_review).
It contains very important information on the `dip_image` object and its
usage. Since it is not the same as a regular *MATLAB* array, it can be a
bit confusing at first.
