*DIPimage* is a very extensive *MATLAB* toolbox for quantitative image analysis.
It makes most of the *DIPlib* functionality available in *MATLAB*, and provides
a lot of additional functionality through M-files.

A GUI gives user-friendly access to many of its functions.
An interactive image display can be used to explore 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D images.

[The *DIPimage* User Manual is available as a PDF](https://diplib.github.io/diplib-docs/DIPimageUserManual.pdf).
It is an extensive document that gives an introduction to the toolbox, and documents
installation, the core `dip_image` object, the interactive image display, customization options,
etc. Documentation for individual functions is available from within *MATLAB* in the
usual way (through the `help` command).

*DIPimage* is a mature toolbox that has been in development since 1999. *DIPimage 3*
is a major rewrite of the toolbox, which is mostly, but not completely,
backwards-compatible.
