\page pydip_user_manual *PyDIP* User Manual

*PyDIP* is the project that defines the interface between *DIPlib*, a C++ library,
and Python. Within Python, however, the package is called `diplib` (`pydip` was already
taken on PyPI).

These pages will get you started using *DIPlib* within Python. If you are familiar with
*DIPlib* as a C++ library, start with the last section, \ref pum_differences.
