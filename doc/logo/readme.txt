../DIPlib_logo.svg is an optimized version of DIPlib_logo_source.svg, with the following
manual modifications:
 - Added `<style>@media all and (max-width:50px) {#hideable {opacity:0;}}</style>`
 - Changed id for all elements except "outer_circle" and "outer_diamond" to "hideable".
This allows the logo to change according to the size it is being rendered at. For small
scales, we only see a colored diamond and a colored circle.
