               <h1>DIPlib documentation guide</h1>
               <p>This document gives some guidance as to how elements are rendered
               in the DIPlib documentation. See the dox++ documentation for basics,
               differences are shown here.</p>

               <h2>Boxes</h2>
               <p>There are too many box colors. These first four should be sufficient for us.</p>
               <aside class="m-note m-default">
                  <h4>Literature</h4>
                  <p>The "literature" box is the same as "see also" and other boxes.
                  It does not grab a whole lot of attention. This should be our "standard" aside box.</p>
               </aside>
               <aside class="m-note m-info">
                  <h4>Attention</h4>
                  <p>This one is a bit more visible than the normal box above. Use it for things that
                  need more attention.</p>
               </aside>
               <aside class="m-note m-warning">
                  <h4>Warning</h4>
                  <p>This one is highly contrasting. Use it for things that are really important to be
                  aware of.</p>
               </aside>
               <aside class="m-note m-danger">
                  <h4>Bug</h4>
                  <p>This one is even more contrasting. Use it to discuss bugs.</p>
               </aside>
               <p>This next set of boxes we shouldn't use in the DIPlib documentation. It'll look more like
               a circus than a serious document.</p>
               <aside class="m-note m-frame">
                  <h4>"par"</h4>
                  <p>The plain "par" is rendered as an obvious frame, less subtle than in
                     the stock CSS.</p>
               </aside>
               <aside class="m-note m-primary">
                  <h4>Note</h4>
                  <p>The "note" box is more attention-grabbing than the "attention" box.
                     Let's not use this box in the DIPlib documentation.</p>
               </aside>
               <aside class="m-note m-success">
                  <h4>Precondition</h4>
                  <p>I'm not sure we need to use this one too. I'd like to keep the number
                  of colors to a minimum. This color happens elsewhere in the docs, but
                  not as background color. This is a bit too strong.</p>
               </aside>
               <aside class="m-note m-dim">
                  <h4>"aside"</h4>
                  <p>This is quite nice, maybe nicer than the plain "par"?</p>
               </aside>

               <h2>Tables</h2>
               <p>To modify the properties of a table, we need to use HTML, we cannot use the <tt>{}</tt> syntax.</p>
<pre>
&lt;div markdown="1" class="m-smaller-font m-spaced m-block m-flat"&gt;
   (insert Markdown table here)
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
               <p>For example here we created a DIV with classes "m-smaller-font" and "m-spaced", so that the font used
               in the table is smaller, and the rows are spaced apart a bit more. However, this causes the table
               to be the last child of its container (the new DIV), and therefore will not have a bottom margin.
               The table will but up against the next element. So we add also "m-block", which will have a bottom
               margin. To make the block not visible (it would normally add a frame), we add also class "m-flat".
               A flat block has a transparent frame, it looks just like it's not there!</p>
