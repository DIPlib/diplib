## Changes to *DIPlib*

### New functionality

- Added `dip::BlendBandlimitedMask()`.

- Added `dip::FreeTypeTool` to render text into images. It depends on the FreeType library to use any font file
  for rendering the text. This functionality is opt-in (that is, by default it is not enabled).

- Added `dip::DrawText()` to render text into images using a built-in, fixed-size font.
