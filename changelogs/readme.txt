The files in this directory contain the change logs. For the 3.0.0 release, which has
a huge change log, we keep two separate files. These files are identical to the ones
at https://diplib.org/changelogs/

As you commit things to the master branch, add relevant notes to the latest change
log file, so that it is easy to create a release.
