## Changes to *DIPlib*

### New functionality

- Added `dip::MakeRegionsConvex2D()`, which works for both labelled and binary images.

### Changed functionality

- `dip::MomentAccumulator` has a new method `PlainSecondOrder()`, which returns the plain old second
  order central moments, compared to the moment of inertia tensor returned by `SecondOrder()`.

### Bug fixes

- `dip::DrawPolygon2D()`, when drawing filled polygons, would skip the bottom row in the polygon. The
  algorithm is a bit more sophisticated now to properly handle these bottom rows. This also takes care
  of some rounding errors that could be seen for polygons with very short edges.

- `dip::ResampleAt` with a `map` input argument and using `"cubic"` interpolation could overflow,
  yielding unsightly artifacts.




## Changes to *DIPimage*

### New functionality

### Changed functionality

## Changes to *PyDIP*

### New functionality

- Added `dip.MakeRegionsConvex2D()`.

### Changed functionality

- The structure returned by `dip.Moments()` has a new component `plainSecondOrder`, which contains
  the plain old second order central moments, compared to the moment of inertia tensor contained
  in `secondOrder`. 

- Operators overloaded for `dip.Image` objects can use lists of numbers as a second argument, which
  is interpreted as a 0D tensor image (column vector). This makes `img / img[0]` possible.

(See also changes to *DIPlib*.)

### Bug fixes

- `__len__()` now properly returns 0 for an empty (raw) image. This makes `if img` fail for a raw image.
