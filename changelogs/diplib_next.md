## Changes to *DIPlib*

### New functionality

### Changed functionality

- The `compressionLevel` argument to `dip::ImageWritePNG()` changed from `dip::uint` to `dip::sint`, allowing for
  -1 to configure the deflate algorithm to use RLE instead of its default strategy. For some images this option
  can lead to smaller files, and for some images to much faster compression.
