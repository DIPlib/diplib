## Changes to *DIPlib*

### New functionality

- Added `dip::Kernel::IgnoreZeros()`, which causes subsequent calls to `dip::Kernel::PixelTable()` for that
  object to also exclude zero values in the gray-scale kernel image.

- Added `dip::ExtendImageToSize()`, which is like `dip::ExtendImage()` but allows instead specifying the
  size of the output image, like in `dip::Image::Pad()`.

- Added a static function `dip::Image::CropWindow()`, similar to the existing non-static one, which takes
  the image size as input.

- Added functions `dip::MeanRelativeError()` and `dip::MaximumRelativeError()`.

- Added `dip::Option::CompareImagesMode::APPROX_REL` as an option to `dip::testing::CompareImages()`, to
  compare pixel values with a relative tolerance.

### Changed functionality

- `dip::testing::Timer::CpuResolution()` and `WallResolution()` are static members.

- Stream output operator for `dip::testing::Timer` decouples the two values, choosing appropriate units
  for them independently.

- Added some more `[[nodiscard]]` annotations.

### Bug fixes

- `dip::ResampleAt(in, map)` didn't copy the color space information from the input image to the output image.

- `dip::GeneralConvolution()` skips zero pixels in the kernel image, as was described in the documentation.
  This makes the operation significantly faster if the kernel has many zero pixels.

- `dip::ExpandTensor()` didn't write to an existing data segment in its output image, even if it was allocated
  to the right dimensions.

- `dip::BoundaryCondition::ASYMMETRIC_MIRROR` didn't work in some functions because it had the same value as
  `dip::BoundaryCondition::ALREADY_EXPANDED`.
