%DRAWLINE   Draws a line in an image
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%  image_out = drawline(image_in,start,end,color,sigma,truncation,blend)
%
%  start:      array containing the start position(s) of the line(s)
%  end:        array containing the end position(s) of the line(s)
%  color:      color of the line(s), either one or one per line
%  sigma:      if larger than 0, draws a line with a Gaussian profile.
%  truncation: if sigma>0, the Gaussian profile is computed up to
%              trunction*sigma from the line.
%  blend:      a string 'assign' or 'add' defining the blend mode. If
%              sigma>0, the blend mode is always 'add'.
%
% DEFAULTS:
%  color = 255
%  sigma = 0
%  truncation = 3
%  blend = 'assign' (sigma=0) or 'add' (sigma>0)
%
% EXAMPLE:
%  drawline(newim,[100 100; 0 200],[200 200; 200 0],255)
