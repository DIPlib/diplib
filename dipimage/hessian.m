%HESSIAN   Hessian matrix of an image
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%  image_out = hessian(image_in,sigma,method,boundary_condition,dim,truncation)
%
%  IMAGE_IN is a scalar image with N dimensions.
%  IMAGE_OUT is a N-by-N tensor image, where each image component
%  is a second-order Gaussian derivative. That is, each
%  pixel contains the Hessian matrix of the image at that point.
%
%  DIM determines along which dimensions to take the derivative.
%  It must be an array of integers in the range 1 to NDIMS(IMAGE_IN).
%  The empty array indicates that all dimensions should be processed.
%  For the N-dimensional image above, if DIM==1, then the output
%  is a scalar image with only the second derivative along the first
%  dimension.
%
%  See DERIVATIVE for a description of the parameters and the defaults.
%
% DIPlib:
%  This function calls the DIPlib function dip::Hessian.
