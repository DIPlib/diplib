%RNGSEED   Seeds DIPimage's random number generator
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%  rngseed
%  rngseed(seed)
%
%  SEED is a positive integer. Negative values will have the sign removed,
%  and non-integer values will be floored. Integer overflow is undefined.
%
%  If no SEED is given, the random number generator will be seeded with a
%  random value obtained from the system (this process is system-dependent).
%  The random number generator is initialized that way the first time it is
%  used, so in general it is not necessary to use this syntax.
%
% DIPlib:
%  This function calls the DIPlib function dip::Random::Seed.
